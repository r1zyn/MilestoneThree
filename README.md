# Practical Assessment – Term 3 – 2022
Code for computer science C# assessment, tasks listed below.
Source code for tasks in [tasks](tasks) directory.

## [Selection and Iteration – 5 marks](tasks/TaskOne.cs)
1.  Use a for loop to display all of the numbers between two integers input by the user (inclusive) that are multiples of 7.

## [String Manipulation – 10 marks](tasks/TaskTwo.cs)
2.  Write a program that asks the user to enter their first name and last name with a space between (i.e. in a single string). Use a conditional-controlled loop of your choice (i.e. pre-condition while or post-condition do-while) to validate the user’s input.
    * only one space may be in the string
    * the first name and the last name must be at least two characters each

Your loop should repeat until the user’s input meets all criteria. Provide suitable message(s) to the user indicating whether or not they have been successful in meeting requirements.

## [Arrays - 20 marks](tasks/TaskThree.cs)
3.  Populate an array with 50 random integers between 64 and 91, exclusive.
    (a) Convert each number stored in the array into its corresponding ASCII letter and store these letters in a second array.
    (b) Search the letters array and output the first index value which contains the letter, 'A'.
    (c) Repeat task (b) but search for a letter input by the user.
    (d) Output a count of how many times the letter ‘J’ appears in the array. Include a suitable label (message) with this value.
    (e) Output all of the unsorted integers array on one line with a space between each integer. Preface the output with the label, *Unsorted array:*
    (f) Sort the integers array and display the sorted array on a second line. Preface the output with the label, *Sorted array:*
    (g) Output the value stored in the first index and the value stored in the last index of the letters array. Display these values on separate lines with the labels, *First index:* and *Last index:* respectively.
